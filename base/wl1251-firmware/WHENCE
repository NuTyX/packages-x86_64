Version: 4.0.4.3.7

File: ti-connectivity/wl1251-nvs.bin

The published NVS files are for testing only.  Every device needs to
have a unique NVS which is properly calibrated for best results.

The driver expects to find the firmwares under a ti-connectivity subdirectory.
So if your system looks for firmwares in /lib/firmware, the firmwares for
wl12xx chips must be located in /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity/.
